# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Oregon, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/).
  Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/), under the supervision of [Dr. Linh Ngo Van](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).
  Before joining UoO, I spent two wonderful years working as an AI Research Resident in Natural Language Processing Group at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/), Vietnam.


  My current research interest lies in exploring generative models at scale, focusing on their applications in Multimodal Learning, Large Language Models, and Information Extraction.

  
  Outside of research, I am also a big fan of [Doraemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon) and used to dream of becoming the next Dragon Warrior like [Po](https://kungfupanda.fandom.com/wiki/Po).
